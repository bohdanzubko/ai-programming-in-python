# Predictive analytics using the Python language

## Task
* The task is to predict the number of passing vehicles on the road based on certain information, which includes the 
day of the week, time of day, opponent's team and other parameters.


* To solve this problem, a classifier based on marginally random forests is used. This machine learning method uses 
an ensemble of decision trees for classification or prediction. Each tree in the forest makes decisions based on a 
random subset of features, which reduces the correlation between trees and improves prediction accuracy.


* To solve the specific problem of predicting traffic volume during stadium matches, we need to create a marginally 
random forest regressor that will predict the number of passing vehicles on the road based on the data contained in 
the traffic_data.txt file.
