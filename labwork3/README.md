# Basic principles of OOP in Python

## Tasks
* First task

    For a positive integer N, calculate the value of the result that
is equal to the sum of "1" in the binary representation of the number N.


* Second task
    
    Create a function that determines the multiplication of the first q elements of an arithmetic progression of real 
numbers with a given starting element of the progression a(1) and the progression step t.

    a(k+1) is calculated by the formula a(k + 1) = a(k) + t.

    *Example. For a(1) = 5, t = 2, q = 5, the result is 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13 = 45045*

    ```a(1) = 4, t = 8, q = 5```
    

* Third task
    
    Create a function that determines the sum of the first elements of a decreasing geometric progression of real 
numbers with a given starting element of the progression a(1) and a given step of the progression t, while the last 
element must be greater than the given alim.

    a(k+1) is calculated by the formula a(k + 1) = a(k) * t, 0 <t <1.

    _Example. For a(1) = 200, alim = 30, t = 0.5, the sum of the first elements greater than alim = 30 is 
200 + 100 + 50 = 350_

  ```a(1) = 40, alim = 8, t = 0.5```


* Fourth task

    Create a function that determines whether a given array of length N+5 is integer values that are sorted in the 
given order (the order is set by the value of the dictionary {0: 'ascending', 1: 'descending'}).
  
    The array and sort order are passed as parameters. The function does not modify the array.


* Fifth task

    Create a function that replaces the value of each element of an integer array with the sum of the value of that 
element and its index, only if the given array is sorted in the specified order (the order is set by the value of the dictionary {0: 'ascending', 1: 'descending'}).

    The array and sort order are passed as parameters.
    
    __To check whether the array is sorted, the function from task 4 is called.__
